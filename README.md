## Implementation Environment

Please install the neccessary libraries before running our tool:

- python==3.6.9
- torch==1.2.0
- tqdm==4.46.1
- nltk==3.4.5
- numpy==1.16.5
- scikit-learn==0.22.1

## Data & Pretrained models:

Please following the link below to download the data and pretrained models of our paper. 

- https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1vO4eF4tma94tsBljLMvVXdG2K4sKOC3s?usp=sharing

After downloading, simply copy the data and model folders to PatchNet folder. 

## Generate Data .pkl from .out files:
please modify the paths(input and output) and run text2dict.py to generate train.pkl and test.pkl.

      $ python text2dict.py -text_path  [path of text data] -dict_path [path of the dictionary data want to store]  -print True
   Example:
      
      $ python text2dict.py -text_path  'train_data.out' -dict_path 'train.pkl'  
      $ python text2dict.py -text_path  'test_data.out' -dict_path 'test.pkl' 
      
please modify the paths(input and output) and run generate_dict.py to generate dict.pkl.

      $ python generate_dict.py -text_path1 [path of our data1] -text_path2 [path of our data2] -dict_path [path we want to store dict.pkl]
   Example:
    
      $ python generate_dict.py -text_path1 'training_data.out' -text_path2 'test_data.out' -dict_path 'dict.pkl'
   Notes:
   training_data.out is the "text format" patches as training dataset (used in trainig phase).
   
   test_data.out is the "text format" patches as test dataset (used in evaluation phase).
   
   The reason why we need evaluation data (test_data.out) is that if we only build a dictionary based on training dataset (training_data.out), there may be some words in test_data.out which never appear in training_data.out. In this case, the generated "dict.pkl" is not the whole vacabulary. Considering it, I put both training data and test data to generate dict.pkl. As dict.pkl is consist of only token-id pairs, using test data will not affect the evaluation phase (no test info leak to model).
   
   If we don't want use test data in generating dict.pkl, we can change the command into this, to only use training data:
   
     $ python generate_dict.py -text_path1 'training_data.out' -text_path2 'training_data.out' -dict_path 'dict.pkl'
   

## Hyperparameters:
We have a number of different parameters

* --embedding_dim: Dimension of embedding vectors.
* --filter_sizes: Sizes of filters used by the convolutional neural network. 
* --num_filters: Number of filters. 
* --hidden_layers: Number of hidden layers. 
* --dropout_keep_prob: Dropout for training. 
* --l2_reg_lambda: Regularization rate. 
* --learning_rate: Learning rate. 
* --batch_size: Batch size. 
* --num_epochs: Number of epochs. 

## Running and evalutation
      
- To train the model for bug fixing patch classification, please follow this command: 

      $ python main.py -train -train_data [path of our data] -dictionary_data [path of our dictionary data]
  For example:
       
      $ python main.py -train -train_data 'train.pkl' -dictionary_data 'dict.pkl'
     
- To evaluate the model for bug fixing patch classification, please follow this command:
      
       $ python main.py -predict -pred_data [path of our data] -dictionary_data [path of our dictionary data] -load_model [path of our model]
  For example:     
  
       $ python main.py -predict -pred_data 'test.pkl' -dictionary_data 'dict.pkl' -load_model './snapshot/2020-12-01_07-45-03/epoch_20.pt'
  Notes:
    "-load_model"  parameter needs the path to saved model. In the training phase, PatchNet will automatically save some intermediate models during the process, which are stroed in folder "snapshot". In the "snapshot" folder, there are folders named by "year-month-day-hour-minute-second", to represent the time when models are stored.
    
     In each, "year-month-day-hour-minute-second" folder, there are many intermediate model files are named "epoch_x.pt". "epoch_20.pt" means the model are saved after training 20 epochs.
     
     We need to load these stored models when doing evaluation. If we load "epocj_20.pt" and do evaluation, that means we only evaluate the performance of the model "epoch_20.pt" (model saved at 20th epoch).
